# MSC3888: Voice Broadcast

As a user I want to be able to send a voice broadcast to all users of a room,
so that I can easily provide information by just talking.
Compared to already existing voice messages it should be possible to listen to
voice broadcast at the time they are being recorded.
Think of this being a live-podcast over Matrix.

Some use-case scenarios for this feature can be to verbally provide updates,
trainings, or talk to a large number of people.

## State of this MSC

This MSC is on hold until Element Call with SFU is ready.
